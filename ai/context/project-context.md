# DalTime — Project Context

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| CDN / Static Hosting | CloudFront + S3 |
| Frontend | Angular 21 (Standalone Components, Signals) |
| API | API Gateway V2 (HTTP API) + JWT Authorizer |
| Backend | AWS Lambda (Node.js 24, ESM) |
| Database | DynamoDB (single-table design) |
| Auth | Amazon Cognito |
| IaC | AWS SAM (`infra/template.yaml`) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

## Environments

| Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `local` | SAM local + DynamoDB local (Docker) |
| `dev` | Auto-deploys on merge to `master` |
| `qa` | Release gate — manual approval |
| `prod` | Production — manual approval after QA |

## Roles

There are exactly 4 roles. Every auth guard, route, and API test must cover all of them.

| Role | Cognito Group | Route Prefix |
|---|---|---|
| `WebAdmin` | `WebAdmin` | `/web-admin` |
| `OrgAdmin` | `OrgAdmin` | `/org-admin` |
| `Manager` | `Manager` | `/manager` |
| `Employee` | `Employee` | `/employee` |

## Blueprint-Driven Development Workflow

**Every feature starts with a blueprint.** No implementation code before a blueprint is written and confirmed.

Use the saved prompts:
- `@new-lambda` — blueprint then implement a Lambda vertical slice
- `@new-component` — blueprint then implement an Angular vertical slice
- `@blueprint-review` — audit an existing implementation against its blueprint

Specs are co-located with their implementation:
- Lambda blueprints: `backend/src/functions/<role>/<feature-name>/0-<feature-name>.blueprint.md`
- Component blueprints: `frontend/src/app/features/<role>/<feature-name>/0-<feature-name>.blueprint.md`

## Styling Rules

- **Tailwind only** — all styling is done with Tailwind utility classes. No Bootstrap, no inline styles, no component `.css` files.
- **Exactly two CSS files** — `frontend/src/styles.css` (Tailwind directives + `:root` brand color variables only) and `frontend/src/debug.css` (`.dt-debug` rule). Do not create any others.
- **No global CSS classes** — `styles.css` must not contain component classes, resets, or `@layer components` blocks. Color tokens belong in `tailwind.config.js`; the `:root` variables in `styles.css` are a secondary reference for SVG/third-party contexts only.
- **`.dt-debug` on every shared component** — every component under `shared/components/` must include `class="dt-debug"` on its root element so the debug border is visible when troubleshooting.

## Library Rules

Before using any library, look up its current LTS version. This is a greenfield project — always pin to LTS, never install outdated versions.
