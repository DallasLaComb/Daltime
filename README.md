# DalTime

**Free shift scheduling for nonprofit teams.**

---

## The Problem

Organizations like the YMCA rely heavily on part-time staff. Scheduling dozens of employees across multiple shifts, locations, and availability constraints is a logistical nightmare. Commercial scheduling software costs $3-10+ per user per month — unaffordable for nonprofits operating on tight budgets.

## The Solution

DalTime is a free, open-source shift scheduling web app designed specifically for community organizations. Built on serverless AWS infrastructure, hosting costs are minimal — even with hundreds of users.

### Key Features

- **Multi-organization support** — One platform serves multiple YMCA branches or similar organizations
- **Hierarchical user management** — Org admins → Managers → Employees
- **Manager-driven onboarding** — Employees join via invitation, no self-registration chaos
- **Mobile-friendly** — Staff can check schedules from any device
- **Serverless architecture** — Scales automatically, minimal hosting costs

## Architecture

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Angular 21 |
| Backend | AWS SAM + Lambda (Node.js 24) |
| Database | DynamoDB |
| Authentication | AWS Cognito |
| Infrastructure | AWS SAM/CloudFormation |

## User Roles

### Web-Admin
Platform-level administrators who manage all organizations within DalTime. They have access to a full organization list and can click into any organization to view and manage it with the same capabilities as an Org-Admin.

### Org-Admin
Organization administrators (e.g., a YMCA branch director) who manage their own organization. They create manager accounts and generate invite codes for managers to join the application. Org-Admins have full control over all managers within their organization and can click into any manager to view and manage things with the same capabilities as that Manager.

### Manager
Managers create invite codes for employees to join and oversee all employees under them. Key responsibilities include:
- Defining shifts that need to be filled
- Setting scheduling constraints (e.g., max 8 hours/day, 40 hours/week per employee)
- Clicking **"Create Schedule"** to auto-generate a schedule based on employee availability and shift requirements
- Reviewing and approving the generated schedule before publishing it to employees

### Employee
Employees interact with the system to:
- Submit their availability
- View their published schedule
- Post their shifts as available for others to pick up
- Pick up open shifts from other employees

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- AWS CLI configured
- AWS SAM CLI
### Local Development

> **Note:** The local Angular dev server connects to the deployed dev backend in AWS. An active SSO session is required.

**VS Code users (Mac):** Run `Tasks: Run Task` → `Start Full Stack` to launch the frontend dev server. Use `Backend: Deploy to Dev` to push Lambda changes. Windows support coming soon.

**Manual setup:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Start frontend (points at deployed dev API)
cd frontend && npm start

# Deploy backend changes to dev
aws sso login --sso-session daltime
cd backend && sam build --parameter-overrides LambdaArchitecture=arm64 --template-file ../infra/template.yaml
sam deploy --template-file .aws-sam/build/template.yaml --stack-name daltime-backend-dev --s3-bucket daltime-sam-artifacts --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --no-confirm-changeset --no-fail-on-empty-changeset --region us-east-1 --profile daltime-dev --parameter-overrides 'AllowedOrigins=http://localhost:4200,https://dev.daltime.com' CognitoUserPoolId=us-east-1_kzQ806uSv CognitoClientId=1nl13tbaqb47s8f0tfc07lc24m
```
