I will give you context on my requirements for a feature. Then I will give you a .test.tsx file in which I want you to write a test for that feature. The test should be written in TypeScript and use Jest as the testing framework. The test should be comprehensive, covering all edge cases and ensuring that the feature works as expected.It will be Test Driven Development (TDD) style, so you will write the test first, then I will provide the implementation code to try to pass the test. Only one test will be provided at a time, and you should not write any implementation code. The test should be clear, concise, and follow best practices for writing tests in TypeScript with Jest, and should only be one at a time.
